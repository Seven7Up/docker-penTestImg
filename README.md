# Docker-PenTestImg
Docker Image for PenetrationTesting and CyberSecurity Development, with mutillidae, dvwa, webgoat and webwolf preinstalled.
With latest version of Mariadb and Apache web server to find the new threats.

You should change some value in Dockerfile.
Change WebGoat and WebWolf downloads links if they changed, User name and Her Group, etc... if you want.

## To build docker image:
    $ git clone https://github.com/Seven-7Up/Docker-PenTestImg.git
    $ cd Docker-PenTestImg
    # docker build -t $USER/pentestimg .

You should manually start services... I will make a services.sh file in Home directory soon.

That's all.
